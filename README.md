# QRadar App Python Library (qpylib)

A library of Python utility functions to assist in developing QRadar applications
by providing a simplified interface to the QRadar App Framework and REST API.

## Compatibility

The qpylib library hosted here is for use only with apps that have been written in
Python 3 to run on Red Hat Universal Base Image. It is not compatible with apps
written to run on a CentOS base image.

Most functions are the equivalent of their pre-Github counterparts, although
there may be some small differences in parameter names and in error handling.
